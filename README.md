What the Booking Assistant Can Do
Get Latest Booking Updates
Pull the latest updates for your bookings. The booking name doesn't need to be an exact match, as our orchestration Lambda function handles name-to-id conversion.

Example:

text
Copy code
"Get updates on my BluewaveHolidays booking."
Translate Booking Details
Translate booking details to English if they are in another language.

Example:

text
Copy code
"Translate the latest booking details from BluewaveHolidays."
Summarize Booking Information
Summarize booking information from a specific reservation. If details are in another language, they will be translated to English before summarization.

Example:

text
Copy code
"Summarize my BluewaveHolidays booking."
Query Bookings Based on a Custom Prompt
Ask specific questions about your bookings. If details are in another language, they will be translated to English before querying.

Example:

text
Copy code
"What are the top resort recommendations for my BluewaveHolidays booking?"

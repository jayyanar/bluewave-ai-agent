### 1\. Developer Setup and Deployment

*   **GitHub Repository:**
    
    *   Developers maintain the source code in a GitHub repository.
        
    *   They use Amplify CLI to manage and deploy the application.
        
*   **Amplify CLI:**
    
    *   The CLI tool is used to initialize, configure, and deploy AWS Amplify projects.
        
    *   Code changes pushed to GitHub can trigger CI/CD pipelines (if set up), deploying changes to AWS Amplify.
        

### 2\. Frontend - AWS Cloud

*   **Amplify Web Hosting:**
    
    *   The applicationâ€™s frontend is hosted using AWS Amplify Hosting, which provides a scalable web hosting solution.
        
    *   Developers deploy the frontend code to Amplify Hosting directly from the CLI or CI/CD pipelines.
        
*   **Amazon Cognito for Authentication:**
    
    *   Cognito handles user authentication and authorization, allowing secure access to the application.
        
    *   Resort managers log in via the UI at **https://portal.bluewaveholiday.net** using credentials managed by Cognito.
        
*   **Route 53:**
    
    *   AWS Route 53 manages DNS and provides a custom domain for the application, ensuring users can access the site via **https://portal.bluewaveholiday.net**.
        

### 3\. Data Sources and Storage

*   **Amazon S3:**
    
    *   Stores PDFs, XLSX files, websites, and other datasources.
        
    *   These files can be uploaded and accessed as needed by different parts of the application.
        

### 4\. Backend Processing

*   **AWS Lambda:**
    
    *   Used for event-driven processing.
        
    *   Automatically triggers to refresh data for Amazon Q (possibly through data ingestion, transformation, or updating search indices).
        
    *   Ensures that the data presented in the application is up-to-date.
        

### 5\. Generative AI with Amazon Q

*   **Amazon Q:**
    
    *   Serves as the generative AI engine for processing and analyzing data.
        
    *   It utilizes the data from Amazon S3 and other integrated datasources to provide intelligent insights or responses.
        
*   **IAM Center for IDP:**
    
    *   Manages identities and permissions for accessing Amazon Q.
        
    *   Ensures secure access to the AI functionalities, only allowing authorized personnel or services to interact with the AI.
        

### 6\. User Interaction - Travel Agents

*   **Chat UI from Amazon Q:**
    
    *   Travel agents interact with the system via a chat interface at **https://chat.bluewaveholiday.net**.
        
    *   This chat UI is powered by Amazon Q, providing generative AI-driven responses and assistance to the travel agents.
        

### Workflow Summary:

1.  **Code Deployment:** Developers push code to GitHub and deploy using Amplify CLI.
    
2.  **Frontend Hosting:** Amplify Web Hosting serves the frontend application, secured with Cognito authentication.
    
3.  **Data Storage:** Data such as PDFs and Excel files are stored in Amazon S3.
    
4.  **Data Processing:** AWS Lambda functions handle event-driven updates to ensure fresh data.
    
5.  **AI Integration:** Amazon Q processes and analyzes data, utilizing IAM for secure access.
    
6.  **User Interaction:** Travel agents use the chat UI powered by Amazon Q for their operations.
    

This workflow ensures a streamlined process from development to deployment, with secure access, efficient data processing, and intelligent AI-driven interactions.
